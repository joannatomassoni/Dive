# Dive
Dive is an iOS app built primarily on React Native and Node.js. It's a live music hub designed for New Orleans musicians and their fans to connect. Musicians can quickly create show announcements, and fans are notified whenever their favorite bands and venues announce those new shows. All users have easy access to the local bands they care about most.

## Running the client

1. Install Xcode v11.1 or later to use the iPhone simulator
2. Run `node index.js` from the server directory to start the back end server
3. Run `yarn start` from the client directory to start the client server
4. Select `run on iOs simulator` from the expo browser page, or press `i` in terminal running the client server
5. Select the `Dive` application from the expo app in iOs simulator

## Backend server URL
1. The deployed URL for the backend server is https://dive-ios.appspot.com

## Running a local backend server

1. Run `ngrok http localhost:8080`
2. Note the Forwarding URL that is provided (the https protocol is what worked for us).
3. Use that URL for all your axios requests on the frontend. 
4. Make sure your backend server is running (a command like `node index.js` from inside the server directory will do)

## Running the backend server with a local database

1. In `server/db/sequelize.js`, make sure the local/development configuration of the the database is set to connect. (`host` should be `localhost`).
2. In your terminal, run `node server/index.js`.
3. Shell into the MySQL database with `mysql -u root`.

## Cloudinary

1. Inside the cloudinary URL is the developer’s cloudinary name
'https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/da4ry89ct/upload'
The ‘da4ry89ct’ within that url is an example of a developer’s cloudinary name.   To get your own Cloudinary name you will need to go to Cloudinary and create an account.  During this process you can create a name or let Cloudinary choose one for you.  You will always have access to this name by going to the dashboard in Cloudinary.  

2. Another thing you will need is the upload present.  Go to the settings section of Cloudinary.  Then proceed to the “upload” tab.  If you scroll down you will see the “upload presets” section.  You will want to set it to “unsigned”.  Once you do this, Cloudinary will give you a preset name.  It will look similar to “oecwb18t”.  This will need to be included inside the fetch request.
